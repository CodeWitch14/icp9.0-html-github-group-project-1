        <h1>React Introduction</h1>
        <hr />
        <h3>What is React.js?</h3>
        <p>
          React, sometimes referred to as a
          <b>frontend JavaScript framework</b>, is a JavaScript library created
          by <b>Facebook</b>. React is a tool for building <i>UI components</i>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How does React Work?</h3>
        <b>ðŸ‘‰ React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Instead of manipulating the browser's <b>DOM</b> directly, React
            creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary
            manipulating before making the changes in the browser DOM.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>ðŸ‘‰ React only changes what needs to be changed!</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what
            needs to be changed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>React.js History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Current version of <b>React.js</b> is <b>V18.0.0 (April 2022)</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initial Release to the <b>Public (V0.3.0)</b> was in
            <b>July 2013</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            React.js was first used in <b>2011</b> for Facebook's Newsfeed
            feature.
          </li>
          <li>Facebook Software Engineer, <b>Jordan Walke</b>, created it.</li>
          <li>Current version of create-react-app is v5.0.1 (April 2022).</li>
          <li>
            create-react-app includes built tools such as
            <b>webpack ,Babel ,</b>
            and <b>ESLint</b>.

        <h1>React Getting Started</h1>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <strong
          >To use React in production, you need npm which is included with
          Node.js.</strong
        >
        <ol>
          <li>
            To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code
            directly in HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            But in order to use React in production, you <b>need npm</b> and
            <b>Node.js installed.</b>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>React Features</h1>
        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>JSX:</b> JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, which allows
            you to write HTML directly within React.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Components:</b> Components are the building blocks of any React
            application, and a typical React app will contain many of these.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Unidirectional Data Flow:</b> React implements one-way data flow,
            making it easier to reason about your app.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Virtual DOM:</b> The virtual DOM makes updates faster by updating
            only the parts of the DOM that need to change.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Performance:</b> React is known for its high performance due to
            its virtual DOM implementation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Extensions:</b> React goes beyond just being a UI library. It has
            a rich ecosystem of extensions for routing, state management, and
            more.
          </li>

        <h1>Why Use React?</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          React is used for building large-scale applications with dynamic data
          changes. Here are some reasons why React is popular:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            React allows developers to build web applications that can update
            and render efficiently in response to data changes.
          </li>
          <li>It makes it easy to create interactive UIs with components.</li>
          <li>
            It helps in building complex applications with ease, due to its
            component-based architecture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reactâ€™s declarative nature makes it easier to debug and understand
            the code.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h1>React Ecosystem</h1>
        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Redux:</b> A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
          </li>
          <li><b>React Router:</b> A standard library for routing in React.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Material-UI:</b> React components for faster and easier web
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Styled Components:</b> Utilizes tagged template literals to style
            your apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Next.js:</b> A React framework for server-rendered applications.

    <div>
      <h1>React Component Types</h1>
      <hr />
      <h3>Functional Components</h3>
      <p>
        These are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument
        and return React elements.
      </p>
      <h3>Class Components</h3>
      <p>
        These are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component and have a render
        method which returns React elements.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Stateful vs Stateless Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Stateful Components:</b> These components can hold and manage their
          own state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stateless Components:</b> These components do not hold or manage
          their own state and are also known as presentational components.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <div>
      <h1>React Lifecycle Methods</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (before
        React 16.8). They allow developers to hook into the different phases
        (mounting, updating, and unmounting) of a component.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>componentDidMount:</b> Invoked immediately after a component is
          mounted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>shouldComponentUpdate:</b> Called to determine if a component
          should re-render due to changes in props or state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>componentDidUpdate:</b> Called immediately after updating occurs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>componentWillUnmount:</b> Called right before a component is
          unmounted and destroyed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <div>
      <h1>React vs Other Frameworks</h1>
      <hr />
      <h3>React vs Angular</h3>
      <p>
        Angular is a full-fledged MVC framework, while React is a library that
        deals with the view component of MVC. Angular uses two-way data binding,
        whereas React promotes one-way data binding. Angular has a steep
        learning curve due to its comprehensive nature, whereas React is easier
        to learn and integrate into projects.
      </p>
      <h3>React vs Vue</h3>
      <p>
        Vue is similar to React in that it's also a view library, but it is more
        opinionated with a lot of features built-in, making it a more
        comprehensive solution out of the box. Vue uses a template-based syntax,
        whereas React uses JSX, which blends HTML and JavaScript.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h1>Advanced React Concepts</h1>
      <hr />
      <h3>Higher-Order Components (HOC)</h3>
      <p>
        A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and
        returns a new component. HOCs are used to add additional functionality
        to existing components.
      </p>
      <h3>Render Props</h3>
      <p>
        Render props is a technique for sharing code between React components
        using a prop whose value is a function.
      </p>
      <h3>Context API</h3>
      <p>
        The Context API allows you to share state across the entire app (or part
        of it) lightly and with ease. It is a good alternative to prop drilling.
