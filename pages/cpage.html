      <p><u><h2>What is C?</h2></u>
        C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
        
        It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
        
        C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>
       <u> <h2>Variables & Constants in C</h2></u>
            <ol>
            <b><li>Variables</li></b>
            Variables in C are named memory locations used to store data that can vary during the execution of the program. They are defined with a specific data type that determines the size and type of data they can hold. Here are the key points about variables:
            <ul>
            <li>Declaration:</li> Before using a variable in C, you must declare it with a specific data type.
            <li> Initialization:</li> Variables can optionally be initialized at the time of declaration.
            <li>Assignment: </li>Once declared, variables can be assigned new values using the assignment operator (=).
            <li> Scope:</li> Variables have a scope that determines where in the program they can be accessed.</ul>

            <b><li>Constants</li></b>
            Constants in C are values that do not change during the execution of a program. They can be of any data type and are declared using the const keyword. Constants provide a way to make code more readable and maintainable by giving meaningful names to values that remain fixed.
            <ul>
            <li>Declaration:</li> Constants are declared using the const keyword followed by the data type and the constant name.
            <li>Usage: </li>Once declared, constants cannot be modified throughout the program execution:
            <li>Advantages:</li> Constants improve code readability by providing meaningful names to values that should not change. They also help prevent inadvertent modification of values.</ul></ol>
