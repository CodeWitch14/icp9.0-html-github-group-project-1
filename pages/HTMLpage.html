    <b><h2> What is HTML?</h2></b>
    <p> 
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).
        
        HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.
