    <p>
        Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block-structured language. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages and is built using a modern approach to safety, and software design patterns by Apple Inc. for iOS applications, macOS applications, watchOS applications, tvOS applications. 
        Swift is easy to learn, easy to implement, safe, fast, and expressive. Developing Swift in the open has its exciting aspects as it is now free to be ported across a wide range of platforms, devices, and use cases.

        The features of Swift are designed to work together to create a powerful language.<br> 
        Additional features of Swift include:<ul type="square">
        <li>Closures (similar to lambda functions in other languages) unified with function pointers</li>
        <li>Tuples and multiple return values</li>
        <li>Concise and fast iteration over a range or collection</li>
        <li>Structs and Classes that support methods, extensions, and protocols</li>
        <li>Functional programming patterns, e.g., map and filter</li>
        <li>Powerful error handling built-in</li>
        <li>Advanced control flow with do, guard, defer, and repeat keywords</li>
        <li>Optionals and force-unwrap</li></ul>
