    <p>
        Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block-structured language. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages and is built using a modern approach to safety, and software design patterns by Apple Inc. for iOS applications, macOS applications, watchOS applications, tvOS applications. 
        Swift is easy to learn, easy to implement, safe, fast, and expressive. Developing Swift in the open has its exciting aspects as it is now free to be ported across a wide range of platforms, devices, and use cases.

    <p>
        The features of Swift are designed to work together to create a powerful language.<br> 
        Additional features of Swift include:<ul type="square">
        <li>Closures (similar to lambda functions in other languages) unified with function pointers</li>
        <li>Tuples and multiple return values</li>
        <li>Concise and fast iteration over a range or collection</li>
        <li>Structs and Classes that support methods, extensions, and protocols</li>
        <li>Functional programming patterns, e.g., map and filter</li>
        <li>Powerful error handling built-in</li>
        <li>Advanced control flow with do, guard, defer, and repeat keywords</li>
        <li>Optionals and force-unwrap</li></ul>
        <h3>Learning about Variables, Constants, Strings, and Operators</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Variables and Constants:</li>
            <ul type="square">
            <li>Variables: </li>These are named containers that store data within your program. You can think of them as boxes with labels where you can place and retrieve information. Their values can change throughout the code's execution.
            Declaring Variables: Use the var keyword followed by the variable name and a colon (:). Then, specify the data type (e.g., Int, String) separated by a space. Optionally, you can assign an initial value using the equal sign (=).</p>
            <li>Constants: </li>Similar to variables, constants hold data, but their values cannot be modified after they are set. Use the let keyword instead of var to declare constants.</ul>
            <li>Strings:</li>
            Strings represent sequences of characters, used for text data. In Swift, strings are enclosed in double quotes (").
            <li>Operators:</li>
            Operators are symbols that perform operations on data. Swift provides various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more.
            Arithmetic Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division)
            Comparison Operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to)
            Logical Operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)</ol><br>
